The coding language that we are using is Python, which is a freely available programming language, used a lot in science. You do not need to understand the code in detail, but it is important that you understand how we analyze and plot the results.\n\nIn order to run this code, you will need to enter some variables that are important for correctly finding the experiment on your computer. There will also be a few options that you can set. You can directly edit the text below in order to make these decisions. \n\nAfterwards, click on the boxes in order and click the \"Run\" button above. This will run the code, and will help you analyze your data. Plots for your results will be displayed below, one-by-one. \n\nThis code will walk you through the analysis. Read the text surrounding this code carefully, because it will describe step-by-step what it is doing with your data, and how to interpret the results that you see. We will also ask you questions that you should try to answer by looking at the figures that this code plots.\n\nIf you are interested in understanding the code line-by-line, we provide comments (the text after a # symbol) which desecribes the logic behind each step that we take. If you are not, please edit the parts that you are instructed to. Otherwise, you only need to click the 'Run' button above, and everything else will happen automatically!"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"First, we need to load your data in from your computer.
